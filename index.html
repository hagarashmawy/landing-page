          <p>
            Palestine, officially the State of Palestine, is a country in the
            southern Levant region of West Asia recognized by 146 out of 193 UN
            member states. It encompasses the Israeli-occupied West Bank,
            including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, collectively known as
            the occupied Palestinian territories, within the broader geographic
            and historical Palestine region. It has a total land area of 6,020
            square kilometres (2,320 sq mi) while its population exceeds five
            million people. Its proclaimed capital is Jerusalem, while Ramallah
            serves as its administrative center. Gaza City was its largest city
            prior to evacuations in 2023.

          <h2 class="title">Tourism</h2>
          <p>
            Tourism in the country refers to tourism in East Jerusalem, the West
            Bank and the Gaza Strip. In 2010, 4.6 million people visited the
            Palestinian territories, compared to 2.6 million in 2009. Of that
            number, 2.2 million were foreign tourists while 2.7 million were
            domestic. Most tourists come for only a few hours or as part of a
            day trip itinerary. In the last quarter of 2012 over 150,000 guests
            stayed in West Bank hotels; 40% were European and 9% were from the
            United States and Canada. Lonely Planet travel guide writes that
            "the West Bank is not the easiest place in which to travel but the
            effort is richly rewarded." Sacred sites such as the Western Wall,
            the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque draw
            countless pilgrims and visitors each year.

          <p>
            Palestinians are ethnically and linguistically considered part of
            the Arab world. The culture of Palestine has had a heavy influence
            on religion, arts, literature, sports architecture, and cinema.
            UNESCO have recognized Palestinian culture. The Palestine Festival
            of Literature (PalFest) brings together Palestinian and
            international writers, musicians, and artists for a celebration of
            literature and culture. The annual Palestine Cinema Days festival
            showcases Palestinian films and filmmakers.

          <h2 class="title">Architecture</h2>
          <p>
            Palestinian architecture encompasses a rich heritage that reflects
            the cultural and historical diversity of the region. Throughout its
            history, Palestinian architecture has been influenced by various
            civilizations, including Islamic, Byzantine, Crusader, and Ottoman.
            Traditional Palestinian architecture is characterized by its use of
            local materials such as stone and traditional construction
            techniques. The architectural style varies across different regions,
            with notable features including arched doorways, domes, and
            intricate geometric patterns. Islamic architecture has left a
            profound impact on Palestinian buildings. Mosques, mausoleums, and
            madrasas showcase exquisite craftsmanship, with notable examples
            including the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and the Great Mosque of
            Nablus. Rawabi is home to the largest Roman amphitheatre in the
            Middle East and the Arab world.
